## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Clamp for fluid font size

### What I learned

It was the first time that I do a overlay on hover and also my first time using Clamp. I need to pratice both to get it perfectly and also be more creative on with the overlay effect.
